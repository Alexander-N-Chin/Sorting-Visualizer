# MIPS Sorting Visualizer

This program visualizes four sorting algorithms using the MIPS assembly bitmap and keyboard tools. The sorting algorithms are bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quick sort.

Academic Project for Karen Mazidi's Computer Architecture Class [CS 2340]

## Usage

This program was built to run in the Mars 4.5 MIPS simulator

Instructions on how to run the program:
```
    1. place all files in the same folder 
    3. Run Mars and open main.asm
    2. Assemble and run the program
    3. Connect the bitmap (inside tools tab)
    4. Set unit width and height to 4x4
    5. Set display width and height to 1024x512
    6. Connect the keyboard (inside tools tab)
    7. Type into the keyboard simulator to play visualizations
    8. keys '1' through '4' to play their associated sorting algorithm
    9. Press '0' to exit the program 
```
